        <h1>The scream</h1>
        <h3>The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is a series of four paintings by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, from
            1893. The work depicts an androgynous figure in a moment of deep anguish and despair. The background
            is the dock of the Oslo Fjord (in Oslo) at sunset. The Scream is considered one of the most important
            works of the Expressionist movement and has acquired the status of a cultural icon, on a par with
            Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.  <br>
             
            The series has four known paintings: two of the paintings in the series, "Anxiety" (Norwegian: Angst)
            and "Despair" (Norwegian: Fortvielse) are held by the Munch Museum in Oslo, another by the National
            Gallery in Oslo and another by a private collection.[1] In 2012, the latter became the most expensive
            painting in history, selling for $119.9 million at auction.[2]</h3>
